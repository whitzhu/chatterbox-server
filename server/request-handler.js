You should implement your request handler function in this file.

requestHandler is already getting passed to http.createServer()
in basic-server.js, but it won't work as is.

You'll have to figure out a way to export this function from
this file and include it in basic-server.js so that it actually works.

*Hint* Check out the node module documentation at http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html.

  // and content.

  // Documentation for both request and response can be found in the HTTP section at
  // http://nodejs.org/documentation/api/

// which is considered a different domain.

// Another way to get around this restriction is to serve your chat
// client from this domain by setting up static file serving.
